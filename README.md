# User Attribute

A simple authentication node for ForgeRock's Identity Platform 5.5 and above. This node reads a specified user attribute and inserts it into the 'shared_state' object to be matched later as part of an Authentication Tree. 

Copy the .jar file from the ../target directory into the ../web-container/webapps/openam/WEB-INF/lib directory where AM is deployed. Restart the web container to pick up the new node. The node will then appear in the authentication trees components palette.

The code in this repository has binary dependencies that live in the ForgeRock maven repository. Maven can be configured to authenticate to this repository by following the following ForgeRock Knowledge Base Article.
